# Brackets Checker

### Project Description

The brackets Checker checks if a string of brackets is valid or not.
A string is considered valid if and only if:
For each opened bracket, there should be a closing bracket of the same type.
Each closing bracket should close the lastly opened bracket.
Multiple line comment tokens consist of two characters, and any text between them should be ignored.
